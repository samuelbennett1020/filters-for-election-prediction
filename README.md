> ‘All polls are subject to a wide range of potential sources of error. 
> On the basis of the historical record of the polls at recent general elections, 
> there is a 9 in 10 chance that the true value of a party’s support lies within 4 points of the estimates provided by this poll,
> and a 2 in 3 chance that they lie within 2 points.’

Anthony Wells: https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/2497-understanding-margin-error

> A poll of 1,000 people has a margin of error of +/- 3%, a poll of 2,000 people a margin of error of +/- 2%

Based on this, the $1 \sigma$ std error is given as 3%.
